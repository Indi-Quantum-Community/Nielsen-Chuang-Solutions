Let's assume $M_m$ is a measurement operator. From the assumption , we have $E_m = M_m^{\dagger} M_m = M_m$, Then
$$ \langle \psi | E_m |\psi \rangle = \langle \psi |M_m|\psi\rangle \ge 0 \ \forall \ |\psi\rangle $$

Since $M_m $ is a positive operator, $M_m $ is Hermitian. Therfore,
$$ E_m = M_m^{\dagger} M_m = M_m M_m = M_m^2 = M_m$$
Thus the measurement is a projective measurement.




\paragraph{2.63} \textbf{Measurement Operators $M_m$} \\%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

We have 
$$ M_m^{\dagger} M_m = \sqrt{E_m} U_m^{\dagger} U_m \sqrt{E_m}$$
$$ = \sqrt{E_m} I \sqrt{E_m}$$
$$ = E_m$$

Since $E_m $ is POVM , for arbitrary unitary $U$, $M_m^{\dagger} M_m$ is a POVM



\paragraph{2.64} \textbf{Construct a POVM} \\%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

We can construct $|\psi_j^{'}\rangle$ that is orthogonal to all states except $|\psi_j\rangle$. That is
$$ |\psi_j^{'}\rangle = |\psi_j\rangle - \sum_{k = 1, k \ne j}^{m} \frac{\langle \psi_j| \psi_k\rangle |\psi_k\rangle }{|| \psi_k \rangle|^2}$$

Then $E_m$ is 
$$ E_m = A|\psi_m^{'} \rangle \langle \psi_m^{'}|$$

where $A$ is chosen such that
$$ E_{m+1} = I - \sum_{j=1}^{m} E_j$$
is positive.
